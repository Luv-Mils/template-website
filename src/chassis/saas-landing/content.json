      },
      {
        "question": "Can I import from Jira, Asana, or Trello?",
        "answer": "Yes. We have one-click importers for Jira, Asana, Trello, Monday.com, and ClickUp. Your projects, tasks, assignees, and labels come over automatically. Most teams are fully migrated within an hour."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does billing work?",
        "answer": "Plans are billed per user, per month (or annually at a 20% discount). You only pay for active users — if someone leaves your team, they're removed from billing immediately. No annual contracts required on any plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data secure?",
        "answer": "Flowdeck is SOC 2 Type II certified with 256-bit encryption at rest and in transit. We run on AWS with daily backups, 99.9% uptime SLA, and optional SSO/SAML on the Team plan. Your data is never used for training or sold to third parties."
      },
      {
        "question": "What integrations do you support?",
        "answer": "Native integrations with Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Figma, and Zapier. Our REST API and webhooks let you connect anything else. API documentation is public and available on our developer portal."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I try Pro or Team features before committing?",
        "answer": "Every paid plan starts with a 14-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required to start. If you decide not to upgrade, you'll automatically move to the Free plan — no data loss, no disruption."
