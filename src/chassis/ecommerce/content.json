      {
        "question": "What kind of wax do you use?",
        "answer": "All of our candles are made with 100% natural soy wax sourced from U.S. farms. Soy wax burns cleaner and longer than paraffin, produces less soot, and is fully biodegradable. We never use paraffin, palm, or synthetic wax blends."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long do your candles burn?",
        "answer": "Our standard 9 oz candles burn for approximately 50-55 hours. Our large 16 oz candles burn for 80-90 hours. For the best burn, we recommend trimming the wick to 1/4 inch before each use and burning for at least 2 hours per session to achieve a full melt pool."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are your candles safe for pets?",
        "answer": "Our soy candles use phthalate-free fragrance oils and cotton wicks, making them a safer choice for homes with pets compared to paraffin candles. However, we recommend keeping lit candles out of reach and ensuring good ventilation. If your pet has specific sensitivities, consult your veterinarian."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer international shipping?",
        "answer": "We currently ship throughout the United States and Canada. International shipping is available to select countries in Europe and Australia. Shipping costs and delivery times vary by destination. All orders over $75 qualify for free domestic shipping."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel or modify my subscription?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can pause, skip a month, or cancel your subscription at any time from your account dashboard. Changes made before the 15th of the month apply to that month's shipment. No cancellation fees, no commitments."
