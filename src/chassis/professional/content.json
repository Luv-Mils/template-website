        "question": "Are you accepting new patients?",
        "answer": "Yes! We welcome new patients of all ages. Your first visit includes a comprehensive exam, digital X-rays, and a cleaning. We'll create a personalized treatment plan and walk you through everything before any work begins."
      },
      {
        "question": "What insurance do you accept?",
        "answer": "We accept most major dental insurance plans including Delta Dental, Premera, Cigna, Aetna, MetLife, and Guardian. We also offer an in-house membership plan for uninsured patients that covers two cleanings, exams, and X-rays per year plus 20% off all treatments."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer sedation for anxious patients?",
        "answer": "Yes. We offer nitrous oxide (laughing gas) for mild anxiety and oral conscious sedation for patients who need more support. Dr. Nakamura has extensive training in sedation dentistry. We'll discuss your options during your consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What should I expect at my first appointment?",
        "answer": "Plan for about 90 minutes. We'll take digital X-rays, perform a thorough exam, complete a professional cleaning, and discuss any findings with you. We believe in informed consent — no treatment starts until you understand the what, why, and cost."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you handle dental emergencies?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We reserve same-day slots for emergencies. Call our main number and select the emergency option. For after-hours emergencies, the voicemail provides Dr. Nakamura's direct cell for urgent situations like trauma or severe pain."
      },
      {
        "question": "What payment options do you offer?",
        "answer": "We accept cash, all major credit cards, HSA/FSA accounts, and CareCredit financing. For larger treatments like implants or orthodontics, we offer interest-free payment plans of 6 or 12 months. Our treatment coordinator will walk you through your options."
